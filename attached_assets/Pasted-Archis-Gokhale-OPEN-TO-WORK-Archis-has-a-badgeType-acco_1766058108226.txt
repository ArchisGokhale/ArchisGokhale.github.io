AboutAbout
Hi, I’m Archis Gokhale, a Computer Science and Engineering student at MIT Pune with a passion for using technology to solve impactful problems.

I love building things—whether it’s scalable products, intuitive systems, or a solid cricket innings.

As the leader of Team Cloudweave, I led our ISRO Smart India Hackathon-winning project, where we redesigned satellite imagery processing with AI, slashing processing time by 40%. 

My obsession? Product development—blending clean code and design thinking to create tech that feels effortless for users.

I live in the trenches of Java, Spring Boot, and DSA, solving real-world puzzles with smart, simple solutions. Off-duty, I’m either mentoring developers, sketching prototypes, or chasing sixes on the cricket field.

Completed My Internship at Northern Trust 👏 

I’ve officially completed my internship as a Software Engineering Intern in the Technology Recovery & Resiliency team at Northern Trust — my first real step into corporate engineering.

Walking into a global enterprise teaches you things no course prepares you for:

Not just systems, but culture.
Not just automation, but ownership.
Not just engineering, but responsibility.

What this journey taught me:

Infrastructure engineering is quiet work with massive impact. 
When automation runs smoothly, no one notices — when it fails, everyone does.

Automation is more than code — it’s consistency and clarity.

Corporate engineering runs on structure — git discipline, documentation, deployments, reviews, testing.

Calm thinking builds resilient systems.

And above all: Teams > Tools.

What I worked on:

I contributed to Infrastructure Automation, Ansible development, Linux systems, and Disaster Recovery automation — the backend work that keeps operations resilient.

A huge shout-out to my manager and the entire team who shaped this experience in the best possible way.

Thank you Sauradip Moitra for leading with clarity, trust, and direction — and for giving me meaningful work that genuinely accelerated my growth.
To my team — Tushar Tajne, Soumya Dutta, Anish Kumar, Mukesh Kumar, and Dinesh Neve — thank you for the constant guidance, patience, and support throughout this journey. I’m grateful for everything I learned from each of you.
A heartfelt thanks to Thomas South, Mary Ekmalian, Rajesh Korde, Colleen Campana and Rachael Wilder for being such incredible mentors. Your insights and time made this internship far richer than I expected.

Special appreciation to Rajesh Puvvada and Pushkar Rangdal for managing all interns with such care, structure, and encouragement — it made a huge difference.
And finally, thank you Sudhir Kumar, Yayati Zende, Stanis Thiruthuvadoss, Anagha Sawant, Anubha Duhan, Nilima Nair, Robert Stone, Rich Stone, and my fellow intern Charlie Tucker for creating a culture of learning, support, and openness.

Every discussion, review, and suggestion from you all shaped my understanding and helped me grow in ways I’ll carry forward.

A lesson I’ll take with me
Resiliency isn’t built during an outage — it’s engineered quietly, long before one.

If you’re trying to break into infrastructure, automation, or backend engineering, I’ve collected all my notes and resource packs.

 👉 Comment “NT”, share your email, and I’ll send everything over.

Gold Victory at Smart India Hackathon 2024! 🏆

I am beyond thrilled to announce that Team Cloudweave has emerged as Gold Winners at the Smart India Hackathon 2024! Our team solved the challenging Problem Statement ID 1736, a problem presented by none other than the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

Our journey began among 98,000+ teams, and through relentless dedication, we secured our place as finalists — part of the top 1.075%, where only 1053 teams competed. From there, we had just a 5% chance to be among the top 50 in our problem statement, and an even slimmer chance of 0.00215% to win. These odds highlight the sheer difficulty of what we achieved, but numbers alone cannot capture the true intensity of this experience.

The Challenge: Problem Statement ID 1736
Our task was to develop an AI-based frame interpolation, video generation, and display system for satellite imagery. The challenge involved complex issues such as deformable clouds, computational complexities, and integrating with modern open-source GIS libraries. It was a monumental task, but we faced it head-on, pushing the boundaries of innovation.

Team Cloudweave: True Heroes
I could not be prouder of my team.:

Archis Gokhale (Team Lead)
Rupak Yeware
Sankalp Gawali
Soham Rupaye
Manas Vernekar
Hazel Ajwani
Your dedication, hard work, and countless sleepless nights made this victory possible. We achieved this win because we worked together, constantly refining our solution, driven by a shared vision and relentless focus.

Our Mentors:
Jayshree Ghorpade-Aher
Bhavana T.

The Rewards and Recognition:

🙌Gold-Plated Trophies
💫ISRO Internships

The honor of contributing to a nationwide innovation movement, and working with one of India’s most prestigious organizations.
This experience has been nothing short of transformative. It wasn’t just about coding or solving problems—it was about pushing ourselves to the limit, facing overwhelming challenges, and emerging stronger. The road was grueling, but the journey has been incredibly rewarding.

To everyone watching, remember—success comes when you're willing to go above and beyond.

Repository: https://github.com/Sankalp-G/cloudweave
Cloudweave is an AI-powered frame interpolation and video visualization system developed for ISRO’s problem statement on improving the temporal resolution of satellite imagery from OGC-compatible WMS (Web Map Services). It tackles the challenge of infrequent satellite updates—typically one image every 30 minutes—by generating multiple intermediate frames using deep learning, creating smooth and continuous videos that reveal dynamic weather patterns like cloud motion, cyclones, and storms in near real-time.

Powered by the FILM (Frame Interpolation for Large Motion) model, Cloudweave effectively handles deformable objects such as clouds that may appear or vanish between frames. It fetches GeoTIFF imagery from WMS servers like MOSDAC and BHUVAN, applies noise reduction via the Sobel Operator, and performs recursive AI-based interpolation to produce up to 30× more frames. These frames are merged using FFmpeg into seamless videos at one-minute granularity.

The system is fully web-based—built with Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, and FFmpeg on the backend, and React.js with OpenLayers on the frontend. Deployed on Vercel, it overlays generated videos directly onto interactive maps, providing a GPU-accelerated, open-source alternative to commercial tools like Mapbox.

Cloudweave aligns with ISRO’s vision of open, self-reliant geospatial innovation. It delivers 70% faster frame generation via GPU+CPU hybrid processing and 40% sharper edge detection using Sobel filtering. Future extensions include adding temperature, precipitation, and vegetation data layers, advancing India’s capabilities in weather monitoring, defense surveillance, and precision agriculture.Repository: https://github.com/Sankalp-G/cloudweave Cloudweave is an AI-powered frame interpolation and video visualization system developed for ISRO’s problem statement on improving the temporal resolution of satellite imagery from OGC-compatible WMS (Web Map Services).

I had the pleasure of working closely with Archis Gokhale, a remarkable MIT WPU student in the Innovation Hub with a deep passion for technology and startups. Archis stands out for his incredible technical acumen and his relentless drive to learn and make things happen. One of Archis's most impressive achievements was his leadership role in the NASA Space Apps Challenge. His execution was nothing short of exceptional along with his 2 co-leaders. He not only guided the team with clarity and purpose but also ensured that every aspect of the project was meticulously planned and executed. His ability to navigate complex challenges while keeping the team motivated and focused was a testament to his leadership skills.

Archis is the kind of individual who doesn't just talk about ideas; he brings them to life. His enthusiasm for learning and his commitment to excellence make him an asset to any team. I do not doubt that he will continue to make significant contributions to the tech and startup world.

I highly recommend Archis to anyone looking for a dynamic, innovative, and results-driven leader.I had the pleasure of working closely with Archis Gokhale, a remarkable MIT WPU student in the Innovation Hub with a deep passion for technology and startups.

This paper presents a novel approach to hand gesture detection and recognition using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach employs Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs) for hand gesture recognition, which outperforms traditional computer vision techniques. The system was trained and evaluated on a large dataset of diverse hand gestures, demonstrating high accuracy and processing efficiency. Additionally, the system was put to the test in real-world scenarios, showcasing its potential for practical applications in gaming, sign language interpretation, and human-computer interaction. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to American Sign Language (ASL) recognition using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed method involves collecting a dataset of ASL letters using a webcam and custom-built software that enables users to perform ASL gestures in front of the camera. The dataset was carefully designed with various variations, such as different hand shapes, orientations, and lighting conditions, to improve the recognition system's accuracy. The pre-processed images were then used to train an LSTM model, which achieved a remarkable 92% accuracy. In order to pre-process the photographs and extract important features, the Mediapipe module was employed, and it was found to be a reliable and efficient solution for handling the volume of data. The team's approach could be used to help deaf people and others who don't speak sign language communicate. The experimental results and implementation details provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach and its potential for future developments in hand gesture detection and recognition using machine learning and Python.This paper presents a novel approach to hand gesture detection and recognition using machine learning techniques.
