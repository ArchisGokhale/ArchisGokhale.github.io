During my internship in the Technology Recovery & Resiliency team at Northern Trust, I built end-to-end infrastructure automation with a strong focus on Ansible, Linux systems, and Disaster Recovery readiness. I designed and developed a complete Certificate Expiry Monitoring POC — including certificate discovery, metadata parsing, HTML reporting with Jinja2, and automated email notifications — while architecting reusable Ansible roles, inventories, and playbooks. I worked extensively with AWX, Git, and Linux fundamentals, performed deep infrastructure validation across servers, implemented system-health checks, and contributed to building a scalable Disaster Recovery Service Catalogue. This role strengthened my foundations in automation, observability, and enterprise-grade engineering practices.

As a computer science researcher, I specialized in developing advanced machine learning models for hand gesture detection and recognition. My work leveraged Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to create highly accurate and efficient real-time systems, particularly focused on American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. By utilizing frameworks such as Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Keras, I designed a robust model that achieved 98% accuracy, demonstrating its practical applications in areas like sign language interpretation, gaming, and human-computer interaction.

I had expertise in deep learning techniques, custom dataset creation, and feature extraction, with a focus on accessibility and improving interaction for individuals with disabilities. My research and development efforts were aimed at enhancing human-computer interaction through innovative technologies that bridged the communication gap for people with disabilities.
