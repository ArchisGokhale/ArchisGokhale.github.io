ROLE: You are a senior creative technologist, AAA game-UI engineer, and WebGL performance specialist. Ship-quality output only. Produce a **single-folder, production-ready** frontend repository that renders an immersive interactive portfolio page. Prefer modular, readable, provable code. Provide build and run scripts, and a short developer README. HIGH-LEVEL GOAL: Create an immersive portfolio website inspired by retro CRT + Steam client + GitHub repo explorer aesthetics. The experience must feel tactile, mechanical, and "hacker-retro but luxe" — heavy use of 3D interactive elements (Three.js), subtle scanlines, CRT curvature, neon type accents, and a dark, textured surface. It should keep the user's attention with continuous interactivity: parallax, hover-driven camera moves, draggable 3D repo cards, and an interactive “contribution graph” made of 3D cubes the user can sculpt. MUST-HAVE FEATURES: 1. Full-screen canvas powered by Three.js (fallback to WebGL2/Canvas for old devices). 2. Docked left vertical nav that looks like a Steam library list (no exact logos) — filterable, searchable, collapsible repos/projects. 3. Top toolbar with retro terminal clock, connection/status indicator, and a small repo-activity graph (animated). 4. Main stage: 3D showroom with multiple interactive "project pods" — each pod: - is a 3D card (rounded-corner metal plate) with a live thumbnail (rendered texture from an offscreen scene), - can be clicked to open a modal-like physical drawer (3D animation), - supports keyboard navigation, draggable on desktop, swipe on touch. 5. 3D Contribution Grid: N×M grid of cubes representing commits / milestones — hover shows tooltip, click expands a cube into a short demo and timeline. 6. Repo inspector panel (right side) that loads markdown README (rendered) + timeline + tech stack badges (SVGs) and live small sandbox (iframe) preview if available. 7. Immersive audio: mechanical UI sounds + synth ambient layer that responds to user actions (optional toggle). 8. Asset pipeline: glTF models + PBR textures, compressed (draco + BasisU) and loaded with GLTFLoader + DRACOLoader + KTX2/ Basis. 9. Performance & graceful fallback: LOD, frustum culling, texture streaming, GPU budget controls, and “low/med/high” quality toggle. 10. Accessibility: keyboard only nav, ARIA labels for interactive elements, and text-only fallback page. VISUAL / UX DIRECTIONS: - Color palette: near-black (#060609) base, deep slate (#0f1724) secondary, neon accent (emerald teal #00e6c9) and warm copper highlights (#b76e30). Subtle CRT greenish scanline for text glows. - Typography: Mono for headings (retro terminal feel), neutral geometric sans-serif for body (system font stack). Strong weight contrast. - UI surfaces: brushed-metal panels, beveled edges, 2xl rounded corners on cards, soft shadows, and subtle bloom on neon elements. - Microcopy: short, sharp, slightly cocky copy lines — "Built. Tuned. Deployed." Keep the portfolio voice edgy & confident. - Motion language: spring-damped camera moves, mechanical hinge for drawers, voxel-pop for contribution cubes. THREE.JS / TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: - Use **Three.js r142+** (or latest stable). Project should compile with Vite (recommended) or Next.js/Remix (if SSR needed). - Use **ESM modules**, TypeScript preferred but provide JavaScript fallback. - Scene structure: - SceneRoot with IBLSkybox and subtle volumetric fog (noise-driven). - MainCamera (PerspectiveCamera) with orbit-like damping, but controlled by a custom input layer (mouse, touch, keyboard). - Stage group that holds ProjectPods, ContributionGrid, and AmbientProps. - Each ProjectPod uses a MeshPhysicalMaterial with canned roughness/metalness maps; thumbnails are dynamic WebGLRenderTarget textures rendering a smaller offscreen demo scene. - Asset loading: - glTF with DRACO compression + KTX2 for textures. Use GLTFLoader, DRACOLoader, KTX2Loader, and PMREMGenerator. - Postprocessing: - use EffectComposer for FXAA, Bloom, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, and subtle Vignette. Add optional CRT shader pass (curvature + scanlines). - State & UI: - React + Zustand (or Redux) managing UI state (selectedProject, quality, audioOn). - UI overlay built with Tailwind CSS (dark theme). 3D interactions should not rely on DOM for hit tests — use raycaster, with a pointer-lock-friendly approach. - Interactivity: - Dragging pods uses raycasting with physics-like spring interpolation (no heavy physics engine needed). - Keyboard: arrows to move focus between pods, Enter to open, Esc to close. - Dev tooling: - npm run dev (Vite), npm run build, npm run preview. - Provide postbuild script that compresses assets via gltf-pipeline and basisu where possible. ASSET GENERATION PROMPTS (for models / textures / thumbnails) - **3D Pod Model (glTF)**: “Create a low-poly, stylized hardware pod model — rounded rectangular base, three recessed status LEDs, mechanical hinge on top. Provide base color (albedo), normal map, roughness map, metalness map, and emissive map (for LEDs). Deliver in glTF 2.0, draco-compressed, <= 80kb when compressed, LOD2 available.” - **Contribution Cube Pack**: “Generate a set of 6 modular cube micro-models: clean cube, cube with engraved lines, cube with circular vent, cube with glowing slice. Provide tiled PBR textures (2k and 512 fallback).” - **Background Props**: “Thin mechanical arms, wiring, and retro knobs — decorative only, low-vertex. PBR textures and glTF output.” ASSET AI-IMAGE PROMPTS (for thumbnails & hero art) - “Ultra-detailed 3840×2160 hero image: retro computer desk with glowing holographic repo cards floating above, neon teal highlights, CRT scanline overlay, cinematic lighting, film grain. No logos. Photorealistic + stylized blend.” - Provide negative prompts: “no text overlays, no trademarks, no logos, avoid faces.” DELIVERABLES (what the agent MUST return) 1. A single Git repo zip containing: - index.html, src/ (React + Three.js code), public/assets/ (models, textures), vite.config.js or equivalent, package.json. - README with run/build instructions, quality toggle instructions, and how to add a new project pod. 2. A docs/ folder with: - assets-prompts.md listing exact prompts for 3D modelers and image generation. - performance-checklist.md. 3. A staging deployment snippet (Vercel or Netlify) with recommended config. 4. A short video (30s) or GIF assets showing the main interactions (if agent can export). 5. A fallback 2D HTML page (pure CSS) for extremely low-end devices. QUALITY METRICS & ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: - Initial load <= 2.5s on a modern broadband connection with performance budget clearly stated. - 60 FPS stable on desktop (modern GPU) at default quality; fallback to 30fps on low-power devices. - Keyboard and screen-reader navigable basic flows. - Must run locally with npm i && npm run dev. EDGE CASES & SECURITY: - Prevent untrusted markdown execution in README rendering (sanitize). - Rate limit dynamic thumbnails generation; cache render targets. - Graceful error UI for missing assets. OUTPUT FORMAT: - First: a ZIP-ready repo tree and code snippets. - Then: exact user-facing README & developer notes. - Then: assets-prompts.md and image-prompt.txt for image model use. - Then: small design-token.json with colors, spacing, and type. FINAL NOTE: Don’t output pirated assets. Take inspiration from Steam/GitHub look and feel, do NOT copy logos, trademarks, or proprietary screenshots. Provide a “how to theme” paragraph to tweak hues, copy, and edge-case branding.
